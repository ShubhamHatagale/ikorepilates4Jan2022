        heading_para1: 'How can Pilates help with Back Pain?',
        para1: 'Pilates is an exercise program designed to improve strength, flexibility, and posture. It has been found to be particularly helpful in relieving back pain and improving posture. Through a series of exercises that focus on the core muscles, Pilates helps to strengthen the muscles of the spine and abdomen, which can help reduce back pain. Additionally, Pilates can improve posture by strengthening the muscles that support the spine and helping to correct any imbalances in muscle tone. For back pain sufferers, in particular, developing awareness of the neutral alignment of the spine and fortifying the deep postural muscles that maintain this alignment are crucial abilities. Pilates helps the muscles of the hip and shoulder girdle become stronger, more flexible, and more supple. These joints move easily and steadily, reducing unneeded torque on the spinal column. The Pilates method also trains patients to be aware of movement patterns that might put a strain on their spines and supports them in switching to patterns that maintain neutral alignment. The patient uses the body effectively with awareness of excessive tension and appropriate attention. But before starting with any Pilates routine, one should take into consideration that it can take several one-on-one Pilates sessions with a qualified Pilates instructor. iKore Pilates expert instructors ensure personalized attention to all its clients.
